  <p>Subject: We need safe streets </p>
  <p>Hello, I am a resident of District 8 and traffic safety is important to me. </p>
  <p>The intersection at Willard and Parnassus is very dangerous. The crosswalk has almost no protection for pedestrians. </p>
  <p>I'm asking you to please prioritize more robust intersection safety along the Parnassus corridor now.</p> 
  <p>Thank you,</p>
